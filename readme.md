# Second homework for Binary Studio Academy

Hello, this is my second homework. 

Integrated all the required instruments of ES6 that were mentioned in the task:

* Block scoping
* Spread and rest operators
* Default parameters
* String interpolation
* Arrow functions
* Classes
* Inheritance
* Super keyword

Also tried the Map() datatype and extended the task for a little by adding the verification of the function's arguments.
